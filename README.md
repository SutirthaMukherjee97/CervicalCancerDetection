# CervicalCancerDetection

This repository represents the strategy of leveraging a deep CNN based system of models to develop a reliable system for detection of Cervical Cancer images.

# Data Preparation

The data is first collected from Kaggle. It has then been pre-processed and augmented samples have been added to the original samples so as to provide a larger training source for our model.


# Model Designing

The model system has been designed to employ snapshot ensembling, so as to obtain an optimized set of parameters of our model, thus enabling it to perform superiorly on unseen data. 

# Model Training

The model has then been trained, several hyperparameters have been analysed to obtain the best possible performance.

# Model Ensembling

The predictions obtained from the snapshot models are then being merged under a fuzzy integral based scheme to deliver the final output.
